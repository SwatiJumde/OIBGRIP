    <h2 class="center">10 Things You Didn’t Know About Albert Einstein:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>He never failed math. This is a popular “fact” promoted on the internet, maybe in an attempt to relate to
            genius. However, it is simply not true. Overall, Einstein was an average student, but math was one area
            where he excelled, unsurprisingly.</li>
        <li>
            Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His involvement is often misinterpreted, with some
            claiming that he helped create the atom bomb. In reality, what he did was write a letter to President FDR
            encouraging him to begin work on such a weapon, which led to the Manhattan Project. Although a dedicated
            pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was convinced that America needed the atomic bomb
            before the Nazis.
        </li>
        <li>
            He was a great musician. If the whole <strong>“genius”</strong> thing didn’t work out, Einstein could have
            become a violinist. His mother played piano so he had the love of music instilled in him—via violin
            lessons—at the young age of five.
        </li>
        <li>
            He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel’s first president, Chaim Weizmann, died, Einstein
            was offered the position, but he declined.
        </li>
        <li>He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife, Mileva Maric, he married his cousin, Elsa
            Lowenthal. He was, actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in their later years. He had affairs he
            never tried to hide, he moved the entire family to Berlin without discussion, and treated her more as a
            servant than a wife.</li>
        <li>
            He won the <strong> 1921</strong> Nobel Prize for Physics. This alone isn’t particularly surprising. What is
            surprising is the fact that he didn’t receive it for the general or special theory of relativity, but rather
            for the photoelectric effect.
        </li>
        <li>
            He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby. But by his own admission, he never made
            a particularly good sailor. In fact, he didn’t even know how to swim.
        </li>
        <li>
            He really didn’t like socks, and usually didn’t wear them. In fact, in a letter to Elsa, he bragged about
            getting away “without wearing socks” while at Oxford.
        </li>
        <li>
            He had an illegitimate daughter. This wasn’t known until the <strong>1980s</strong> , but according to
            correspondence between Albert and Mileva it was determined that the two had a daughter in <strong> 1902
            </strong> called Lieserl. At one point, all mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is unknown.
        </li>
        <li>
            His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his autopsy took his brain without
            permission. He eventually got the permission necessary from Einstein’s son, but he was fired from Princeton
            when he refused to turn the brain over. He kept it for over forty years before finally returning it in
            <strong>1998.</strong>
